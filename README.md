Data Transformation
1. Smoothing: Remove noise from data.
2. Aggregation: Summarization, data cube construction.
3. Generalization: Concept hierarchy climbing.
4. Normalization: Scaled to fall within a small, specified range and aggregation. Some of the techniques
that are used for accomplishing normalization (but we will not be covering them here) are:
a. Minâ€“max normalization.
b. Z-score normalization.
c. Normalization by decimal scaling.
